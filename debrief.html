            You've Been Hacked
        </header>
        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <p>
            You've just experienced a simulated phishing attack cooked up by two devious students of the Cybersecurity
            elective. This is an exercise aimed at raising awareness
            and educating on how to avoid falling victim to real phishing attacks and none of your credentials have been
            stolen.
        </p>
        <h2>Understanding Phishing Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing is a cyber attack where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information,
            like passwords. In this simulation, a deceptive login page mimicking
            the school's Microsoft login was created, prompting victims to enter their credentials, which may be used to
            gain access to their accounts.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Avoid Falling Victim to Phishing</h2>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Be Skeptical:</strong> Always double-check the legitimacy of unexpected emails, messages, or
            links. Avoid providing personal information without verifying the source.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <strong>Verify the Sender:</strong> Confirm the identity of the sender before clicking on any links or
            sharing sensitive information. Legitimate organizations won't request sensitive details via email.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <strong>Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Enable 2FA whenever possible to add an extra layer
            of security to your accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your operating system, antivirus software, and
            other applications to patch security vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. <strong>Do Not Repeat Passwords:</strong> Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. If one
            account is compromised, using unique passwords helps control the damage and prevents unauthorized access to
            other accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. <strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you receive suspicious emails or messages, promptly
            report them to your IT department or the appropriate authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, staying informed and vigilant is crucial for protecting yourself and your sensitive information
            online.
